        <basic name ="Cheddar Cheese" amount ="1/2" unit ="cup"/>

    </ingredients>
    <preparation>
      <step> Set a large, covered pot of salted water over high heat to boil. Add macaroni and cook until just al dente (avoid overcooking). Drain macaroni and set aside. In a large wide pot over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Sprinkle flour over butter, whisking to incorporate and make a roux. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until roux is light golden, about 4 minutes. Gradually pour in milk and cream, whisking constantly to incorporate and make a béchamel sauce. Raise heat to medium-high and bring sauce to a low boil, whisking constantly. Reduce to a simmer, whisking occasionally, and cook until béchamel sauce is thick and coats the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes more.
        Add 2 tsp. salt, pepper, and mustard powder. Add the cheeses in three batches, whisking until each addition is completely melted before adding more. Remove from heat.
        Add the drained macaroni to the pot with the cheese sauce and stir well to coat. Transfer macaroni mixture to the buttered baking dish and place on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle topping evenly over macaroni and bake until golden and bubbling, 18–22 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes before serving.

    <title> Double-Double Cheeseburgers </title>
    <cuisine> American </cuisine>
    <ingredients>
      <basics>
        <basic name ="Chicken" amount ="1" unit ="cup"/>
        <basic name ="Oil" amount ="2" unit ="spoons"/>
      </basics>
        <spices name ="Black Pepper, salt, oregano" amount ="1" unit ="spoon"/>
    </ingredients>
    <preparation>
      <step> Arrange racks in top and bottom of oven and place a rimmed baking sheet on bottom rack; preheat to 450°F. Beat eggs in a large shallow bowl. Using a fork or your fingertips, mix breadcrumbs, Parmesan, 3 Tbsp. oil, 3 tsp. oregano, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper in another large shallow bowl or plate.
        Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dip in egg, allowing excess to drip back into bowl. Dredge in breadcrumb mixture, shaking off excess, then pressing to adhere. Transfer chicken to a baking sheet.
        Carefully remove preheated baking sheet from oven and generously brush with oil. Transfer chicken to baking sheet and return to bottom rack. Roast 6 minutes, then carefully flip (use a spatula to scrape under cutlets) and sprinkle with mozzarella. Place baking sheet on top rack and continue to roast until juices run clear, mozzarella is melted, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of cutlet registers 165°F, about 4 minutes more.
        Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook onion, stirring, until softened, 3–4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add marinara sauce, red pepper flakes (if using), 1/4 cup basil, and remaining 1/2 tsp. oregano, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper. Cook, stirring, until sauce starts to bubble. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until chicken is ready, stirring occasionally, at least 5 minutes.
        Divide sauce among 4 plates. Top with chicken and torn basil.

    <title> Marbled Pumpkin Cheesecake </title>
    <cuisine> American </cuisine>
    <ingredients>
      <basics>
        <basic name ="boneless, skinless chicken thighs" amount ="12" unit ="pieces"/>
        <basic name ="Sweet paprika" amount ="1/2" unit ="cup"/>
      </basics>
        <spices name ="fresh thyme sprigs, Black Pepper, salt, cloves, garlic" amount ="1" unit ="spoon"/>
    </ingredients>
    <preparation>
      <step> Rub the chicken with paprika, salt, and pepper and set aside at room temperature for at least 1 hour or preferably in the refrigerator at least 8 hours or overnight.
        Preheat the oven to 400°F.
        In a large sauté pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and cook, stirring, until softened but not colored, 2 minutes. Add the chicken pieces and fry, turning as needed, until golden on both sides, 5 to 8 minutes. You want them nicely colored on the outside but not cooked through. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain briefly, and then arrange the pieces in a cazuela or baking dish large enough to hold them in a single layer.
        Remove the crushed garlic from the oil and discard. Return the pan to low heat. Add the minced garlic and cook briefly. Add the thyme, bay leaves, sherry, and broth, raise the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and pour over the chicken.
        Bake the chicken until cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and discard the bay leaves and thyme. If the pan juices are thin, transfer to a small saucepan and cook over medium high heat until reduced, and then return to the cazuela. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve at once.You also can complete the cooking on the stove top. Sauté the minced garlic as directed, return the chicken to the pan, add the sherry and broth, and simmer, uncovered, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the chicken is tender, 15 to 20 minutes
